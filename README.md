News App

Pitch 

The lack of trust due to inaccurate information spread by media has been frustrating me over recent months. In search for a solution, I came up with the idea to create a news app that brings in more readers due to minimal bias whereas most news sources profit off of bias. My approach revolves around discussion. If I can create an app that is a mediator and promoter of civilized arguments, it would incentivize me to create unbiased articles so people can have different opinions. My target market is politically involved or curious members of Gen Z because we are less willing to read traditional, longer news articles and we have a hunger for stimulation which is difficult to satisfy with just the written word. My app is going to b multimedia involved. Photos and video will hold the same weight as the article itself. Instead of a 10 paragraph article, I am limiting myself to just one paragraph. While people might not get the same extent of understanding of an issue or topic, it would get them to at least read something. In terms of promoting discussion, each article is set to have a designated yes-or-no question where the user can vote on a topic. They will then see a set of statistics presented through various graphs displaying the different sides groups of people take. This will provide insight into what the majority of people actually think instead of an emphasis on extremes which is commonly seen in our media. After viewing the statistics generated from that question’s response, the user can click a “discuss” button which will put them into an anonymous 1 on 1 chat with another user who disagrees with their answer. This will allow for a space where users feel comfortable talking about their opinions. To promote good conversation and avoid trolls, you can report users. You will also be allotted five votes each day which you can give out to people who make good conversation. It is almost like a follower. It is a status symbol showing you know how to discuss issues. This status would show in the general comments section allotted to each article by dictating the order in which comments are seen. If you have 1000 votes from good conversation and everyone else has 50, your comment will be at the top. This feature solves two issues: holding people accountable and incentivizing good conversation. In addition to these many functions, there will be reposting of articles on your own page, private or group messages, and friending. This will create a social space where people want to show what they are learning, talk about something someone said, and generate more screen time. Now, normally, more screen time is a bad thing for the user, but in this case, they are becoming more open minded and informed due to that increase.

Business

To bring in revenue, I will be able to sell useful data based off of people’s votes too other businesses or people.  I will also have a way so you can buy more votes for that day to give to people you have a conversation with. 
The articles will be written in-house which shouldn’t have anywhere near the same cost as a typical newspaper due to the truncated articles. Writers would require some form of bias training. They would reference the Associated Press to see what should be reported on and the story behind it. To get started, I could find people willing to write and pay them in equity.

Screens

Article Screen - Large photo as background that is unique to a specific article. Article sits on top screen with black gradient background. Comment, repost, and share buttons are on the right. The tab bar is at the bottom of the screen floating on the photo. If the large vote button is clicked it will blur the background and prompt a question with a yes and no button. After a vote is put in, the statistics page will appear with the discuss button at the bottom. To view an entirely new article, you just swipe up.

Explore Screen - Articles are boxes where the larger size indicates a story that is getting a lot of interaction whereas a smaller size means less interaction. There will be a search bar at the top of the screen.

Messages Screen - Will have two categories at top of screen being discussions and messages. Discussions is the anonymous one-on-one talks. Messages are just chats with people you friended or wish to message.

Profile Screen - Standard social media profile outline: followers, following, and votes. Profile feed will be articles you have reposted in a condensed rectangle format that only displays the title
